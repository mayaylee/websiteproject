<h2>Project 1: <br> <i>Southworth Planetarium Logos</i></h2>

<p> &emsp;The plan for this project was to create an attention grabbing logo that when you look at it you think of the Planetarium. The design would be taking elements from local Maine iconography as well as University of Southern Maine iconography. <br> &emsp;The logo will be composed using a circular design while using flat coloring and shading using the ombre tools within Adobe Illustrator's program. The iconography that I chose for the design was using the planetarium dome, a planetarium telescope, and the Portland head lighthouse. <br> &emsp;The foreground will contain the planetarium where you will be able to "see" the inside of the dome. This will be depicted by creating a galaxy within the dome resembling a galaxy and some seats viewed from the back. The telescope is placed above the dome coming into the circle from the right side. On the left side of the circle will be where the lighthouse will be portrayed. The background of the circular logo will be an ombre sky scene. I also added the constellation of Canis Major to represent the mascot of our school:the husky.   </p>

<p>The designs below were the two logos that I created for this assignment</p>

<h3><b> Project 2: <br> <i> Cryptid Creation</i></b></h3>
<h4> Scientific Name: <b><i>Cimeterium Os Abactor</i> <br> Common Name:<i>Fures</i></b></h4> 
	<img src="media/photocryptid.jpg"> 

<p> &emsp; This monster robs bones from forgotten graveyards to try and build up their own body structurally. The only problem is that they don't know when to stop. The myth that came up with this creature was an old story told around campfires in the northeastern area of the U.S. about what happens if people forget about the dead. There are a large amount of forgotten graveyards within the northeast portion of America due to the history of settlers, colonists, and soldiers. <br> &emsp; The appearance of this creatre is a blob of blacky-red flesh that is able to extrude long, thin branches to drag themselves around terrain. They vary in size and shape as they all grab bones in no specific order other than the skull. The Fures specifically look for skulls first so they are able to form their sickly flesh around the skull to create some sort of head to stalk humans and talk to unsuspecting humans. </p>
<p> &emsp; The composition of this photo manipulation project is inspired by found footage films and analogue horror shorts. The picture uses the Dutch angle and is a blurry flash picture set in a decrepit graveyard within a forest at night. There are two entities seen in this picture lurking around the graves. The photographer became terrified once noticing which is why the picture appears grainy, blurry, and off center.      


<h5><b> Project 3: <br> <i> Real Marriage</i></b></h5>
	<p> &esmp; The plan for this video project was to use Premier Pro to clip together videos and audio from videos about marriage from the early to late 1900s found from Archive.org. The idea was to create a satirical short film of how marriages were in the past decades. I found and used audio clips talking about the "happy relationships" within married couples over video clips of couple arguing or looking annoyed at each other's actions. I didn't just want to mash different clips together so I created some sections of videos overlaying eachother to create more of a dynamic and interesting composition. I also tried to add transitions where there will be fades to black in between each audio or video switch along with a static audio to make it seem like someone was trying to change a radio or tv channel to something else but still finding more issues about marriage. I was trying to convey some kind of television ad that gets corrupted in some way. I wanted this video to be seen as satirical but also informative to show people how these relationships really looked on the inside and that this does still happen occasionally.</p>
<p> &esmp; The video starts with color annd then fades into black and white film for the majority of the video. A woman walks into frame being the "average" woman of the day and all her goals for life but it slowly fades and transitions into a woman sitting on a train reminiscing about how her apst year of marriage has been going. She talks fondly of her experiences and fond memories are overlayed over the woman but then the video fades again into a different situation. She keeps talking fondly about her life so far but now I started overlaying images and clips of different arguments between couple and women frustrated over marital issues. This theme follows over some other clips of "happy" marriages along with audio talking about marriages back in these decades. My hope for this video project was to create a discussion between what may happen on the inside and outside of marital situations. Situations like these still happen in the modern era and I mainly wanted to show that there aren't always happy endings to a lot of marriages and in the video it even mentions the rates of divorce. I think my message is conveyed thoroughly and I really enjoyed creating this discussion in the form of this video. The link below will lead you to the google drive of all my projects and you can view the video there labeled "Project 3" as the file was too big to add to this website. The files I used can also be found within this folder. </p>

<h6><b> Project 4: <br> <i> Touch Deigner video</i> </b></h6>
	
    <p> &esmp;This project was a fun experiment that connected Arduino code, Arduino sensors, and the Touch Designer software program. I had picked a distance sensor to use for my project so I attached the arduino code to the bread board to connect to Touch Designer. My plan for this project was to have a video playing and the audio would only play if the person is close to the sensor. The audio of the video will be audible but very quite so a person owuld have to get up close to the sensor for the audio to get louder and for the viewer understand what the video is saying. The video playing is about the reproductive organs of women which was recorded in the early 1900s. I thought thus video was so interesting because it is an accurate representation of the female reproductive organs' anatomy yet it is from a period of time where women really had no ownership of their own bodily autonomy. If I were to display this video with the sensor code I would create a sculpture of a woman waist down and would set up the video to be situated right between the figure's legs. I wanted people to be confronted with female anatomy and for people to be forced to be face to face with something that is so controversioal in modern times. </p>
<p> &esmp;The video file was also too large for this format so the final product can be found in the google drive link as mentioned above under the Project 4 file. There are also some screenshots in the folder that showcase the Arduino code and Touch Designer set up as well. </p>
